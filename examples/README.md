# Examples
This directory includes basic examples on how you could use `val-loader-modernizr`. You can run these examples yourself by cloning the repository, navigating to one of the example directories and running the `webpack` or `webpack-dev-server` command from there.

```shell
$ cd examples/<example>
$ ../../node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
